IMPORTANT NOTE WHEN UPGRADING THE JDT.

Starting from JDT 3.33.0 we need to include 2 jars, the jdt core jar and the jdt compiler batch jar.

For ant you can download both jars and there sources by downloading the eclipse sdk from
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

After download and extract the target build jars will be found under eclipse/plugins in the extracted folder.
