IMPORTANT NOTE WHEN UPGRADING THE JDT.

The digital signature on the jdt jar file needs to be removed by removing the following files
from the jar:
/META-INF/*.RSA
/META-INF/*.SF

Failure to do so will cause the open-source build process to file with an obscure error (e.g. rmic
failing).

Also move the jdtCompilerAdapter.jar out of the jdt jar file and rename it to reflect the
version. E.g. if the jdt jar file was named org.eclipse.jdt.core-3.8.2.v20120814-155456.jar,
rename the jdtCompilerAdapter.jar to jdtCompilerAdapter-3.8.2.v20120814-155456.jar

Starting from JDT 3.33.0 we need to include 2 jars, the jdt core jar and the jdt compiler batch jar.
