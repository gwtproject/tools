To recreate the sourcemap-rebased.jar

1) Check out closure-compiler from git

  git clone git@github.com:google/closure-compiler.git

2) Apply the two git patches in this directory:

  git am $GWT_TOOLS/lib/jscomp/20231112/0001-Implement-OriginalMapping-as-an-autovalue-rather-tha.patch
  git am $GWT_TOOLS/lib/jscomp/20231112/0002-Build-tooling-to-produce-a-proto-free-sourcemap-reba.patch

3) Run bazel to produce the new rebased jar:

  bazel build //src/com/google/debugging/sourcemap:sourcemaps-rebased

4) Copy the resulting jar into its own versioned directory along with
   an updated version of this file and the patches above.
