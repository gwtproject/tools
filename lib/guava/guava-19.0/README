This is version 19.0 of guava-libraries (Google core Java libraries,
https://github.com/google/guava/).

In order to prevent conflicts with user code which relies on Guava,
we've used jarjar (http://code.google.com/p/jarjar) to rebase this library.
The "com.google.common" package has been renamed to
"com.google.gwt.thirdparty.guava.common".

To build guava-19.0-rebased.jar:

1) Download guava-19.0.jar to guava-19.0.jar

2a) Download jarjar from http://jarjar.googlecode.com/files/jarjar-1.4.jar

2b) Rebase guava-19.0.jar:
    <jarjar command> process guava-19.0.jarjar-rules guava-19.0.jar guava-19.0-rebased.jar

3) Clean up the resulting jar to remove META-INF:
    zip guava-19.0-rebased.jar -d META-INF/*
