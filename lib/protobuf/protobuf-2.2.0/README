This is version 2.2.0 of the Java Protocol Buffer Library. We use protocol buffers
communication protocol between the Development Mode Server and Remote Viewers.

To build protobuf-java-2.2.0.jar:

1) Download http://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.2.0.tar.gz
2) Unzip the archive

3) Follow the "Installation - With Maven" instructions located in java/README.txt.
Note that Maven is not required; one can altenatively follow the
"Installation - Without Maven" instructions.

NOTE: If you decide to use Maven, be sure to add:  

<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>

as a child of the <project> tag in the java/pom.xml file. This will prevent 
platform-dependent encoding warnings during the packaging step. See
http://maven.apache.org/general.html#encoding-warning for more information.

In order to prevent conflicts with user code which relies on Protocol Buffers, 
we've used jarjar (http://code.google.com/p/jarjar) to rebase this library. The
"com.google.protobuf" package has been renamed to "com.google.gwt.dev.protobuf".

To build protobuf-java-rebased-2.2.0.jar:

1) Download jarjar
2) Run jarjar as follows:

<jarjar command> process <jarjar rules file> protobuf-java-2.2.0.jar protobuf-java-rebased-2.2.0.jar

  where:

   <jarjar command> - the command used to run jarjar (typically java -jar jarjar-1.0.jar)
   <jarjar rules file> - a rules file for jarjar. In this case, it should consist of the following:

     rule com.google.protobuf.**  com.google.gwt.dev.protobuf.@1
   
3) Remove the META-INF directory from protobuf-java-rebased-2.2.0.jar. You can do this
   by expanding the jar, deleting the META-INF directory, and rebuilding the jar with the
   -M (no MANIFEST) switch.
